### What is 2FA-Authenticator?

2FA-Authenticator is a browser extension that allows you to authenticate your accounts easily. The extension generates two-factor authentication (2FA) codes for your accounts and displays them in your browser so you can copy and paste them into the corresponding website.

### How does it work?

When you visit a website that requires two-factor authentication, with the 2FA-Authenticator extension installed, you can scan the account's QR code on the website, and the extension will generate a two-factor authentication code for that account. You can then copy the code and paste it into the website to complete the authentication.

### How to install?

You can install the 2FA-Authenticator extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/2fa-authenticator/pnnmjhghimefjdmdilmlhnojccjgpgeh).
